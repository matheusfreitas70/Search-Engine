# Search-Engine
On this repository I will keep my assignments from the Information Retrieval class at UFMG ( Federal University of Minas Gerais ).

Here we have a complete search engine: crawler, indexer and retriever.

There are two crawlers: CkSpider, that used the chilkat library and the crawler that uses just gnu libraries like curl.
