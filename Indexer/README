This is the indexer.

The repository is divided into 8 folders:
* .tmp: The temporary folder. The indexer uses this folder to sort the index.
* bin: The bin folder is used to keep the binary files, but the main.
* doc: Documentation folder.
* documents: Folder to keep the documents to be indexed.
* gumbo-parser: Folder that contains the parser used by the indexer.
* output: The output folder is where the indexer puts the final index,
          and other files.
* src: This folder contains the entire source code of the indexer.
* tst: The test folder is where some library tests is kept. 


# Before running the indexer, make sure to put the name of the files that
contains the documents to be indexed at DOCFILENAMES.

# install.sh is a shell script to install dependencies like the
  gumbo parser and libiciu.


To run the indexer just run make and then ./main
